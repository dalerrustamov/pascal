# pascal
This is a top down compiler that compiles pascal code. The compiler is able to compile if, while, compound statement and assignment statements.
I gave an example of a pascal code below that my compiler compiles in less than half a second:

begin
    while z=6 do
       if x > 5 then
          x:=5
       else
           begin
          	y:=6
            end   
end.
